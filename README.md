This repository is for use with the Pearson Publishing live webinar "Beginning Machine Learning with `scikit-learn`."  Versions of this material are used by other training provided by David Mertz and [KDM Training](http://kdm.training).

If you have attended one of the webinars using this material, I encourage you to complete the survey on it at: [Machine Learning with scikit-learn survey](https://goo.gl/pghpzD).  As folks fill this out, we will fold back the updated answers into the dataset used in the lessons themselves.
